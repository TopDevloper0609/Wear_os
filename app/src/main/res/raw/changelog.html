<h3><a id="Version__200__Access_Token_Login__2"></a>Version 2.0.0 (<em>Access Token Login</em>)</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p><strong>P.S: The icon change was due to Play Store was about to ban FastHub due to impersonating GitHub’s logo and I’d to appeal with new icon
        to bring back FastHub (I hate the new icon too!) &amp; hopefully soon it’ll be replaced with something nice.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p><strong>P.S: If you were using version before 1.6.0 &amp; you can’t see your Organizations list, you’ll need to re-login again so GitHub auth
        FastHub to list down your Orgs.</strong></p>
